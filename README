Streamlined
===================
Streamlined allows you to quickly generate useful user interfaces, declaratively.

After installing the plugin, you MUST add the following line to app/helpers/application_helper.rb:

include StreamlinedHelper


Then, to make any controller into a Streamlined controller, do the following:

class MyNiftyController < ApplicationController
	layout 'streamlined'
	acts_as_streamlined
	
	...[anything else you want to do]
end
